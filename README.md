# Physical Education Form Generator

## Why

The form I have to do constenetly has me writing a word and for each letter writing an exercise so I didn't want to do it anymore.

Is it still a bit tedious? Yes

Was it a great experience? Of course

## How to use it

Baisically, just put the letters of the, what I am calling letter definitions, in order with a new line after every letter definition in the first text area.

Then, click okay so that the system stores it.

Next, put in your words into the second text area.

Lastly, click format and in the last text area the answers will pop up.
